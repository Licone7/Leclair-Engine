# Contributing to L'eclair Engine 

Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to our engine! Whether you're new here or have hung around a while, this guide will contain everything to get you 
started.

## New Contributors
If you are new to contributing, please first familiarize yourself with Github and Git. Then read through this engine's repository to get an understanding of how the 
engine works. Make sure you know about the different libraries and APIs the engine uses.

The issues and projects tabs are great places to find something to get started with. Issues labeled with "good first fix" are especially great to begin with.
After this, fork the repository and put your skills to work!

## Pull Requests and Code Styles

When you think your contribution is ready, open a new pull request. To increase the likelihood of your PR being merged, make sure to follow the basic guidelines below.
Following these makes reviewing easier and quicker, which makes the integration process work smoothly. 
- Title the pull request appropriately, based on what the PR is for.
- Likewise each commit in the PR should also be titled based on what it is for. 
- If the PR deals with large amounts of code, don't smash tons of work into one commit.
- Make sure to describe what your changes are and what the changes do when you submit the pull request.

When writing code, please follow these rules for styling.
- Do not write sloppy code; format it at least using your IDE's formatter.
- Reduce the number of warnings as much as possible.
- Make sure to list your name as an author when creating new files.
- Write JavaDoc that is explanatory and easy to read.
- Use comments; these make understanding the code easier for others.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Creating new issues is essential to the engine's development. If something isn't working as you'd expect, open a new bug report. 
- Explain what you were expecting and what happened instead.
- Give the steps in order to recreate the problem.
- Include details about what OS you are using and what API versions you're using.

Any extra information that may be useful is always helpful when writing a bug report. When creating a new feature request, describe in detail what the feature is you'd like the engine to have and why it'll contribute to the improvement of the engine. Issue templates are given for your assistance.
